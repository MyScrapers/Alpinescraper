        "DESCRIPTION": "Discover a preserved environment located between Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc. The Franco-Swiss Portes du Soleil area extends over the Aulps and Abondance valleys and has 650 km of slopes. A vast playground for snow sports enthusiasts, this cross-border area offers a unique experience of discovering the mountains between France and Switzerland. The area is popular in the summer, with its 800 circuits and 650 accessible mountain bike trails and welcomes several million visitors annually who contribute to bringing the region to life all year round. One of the most popular resorts in the Portes du Soleil ski area, Les Gets offers slopes suitable for all levels. Les Gets is one of the most popular resorts in the Alps thanks to its access to the Portes du Soleil area but also thanks to its proximity to the slopes and ski lifts. An hour's drive from Geneva airport, Les Gets is very well served by public transport, both internal and international, hence its strong tourist attraction which benefits the rental market. The resort also benefits from the Famille Plus Label which recognizes the most dynamic and family-friendly towns. It is in this small residential hamlet that the Ferme des Pistes will be built. Its location at the foot of the slopes gives it an undeniable advantage. Ski enthusiasts will have direct access to the La Turche chairlift a few minutes' walk away. The Perrières Express chairlift is a three-minute drive away and the Chavannes Express chairlift is five minutes away going towards the center of the village where all the shops and restaurants are also located. Facing northwest and southeast, offering unobstructed views of the surrounding mountains, the residence will benefit from exceptional views. The architecture of the building will respect the codes and practices of mountain construction: traditional wooden frame and local stone. The recesses of the facades and roofs punctuate the architecture of the whole. Rising over only three floors, this collection of 20 apartments of 2 to 5 rooms and two individual chalets benefits from optimized surface areas. A main entrance with elevator serves the upper floors. On the top floors, magnificent penthouses will benefit from double height ceilings and magnificent terraces, extending the living spaces to the outside and bathing the interiors in light.
